# JavaScript Stuff

The code in this repository is my personal sketchpad for whatever stupid code ideas pop into my head. A few rules:

1. Do not assume anything you get from this repo will _work_. Very little testing has been done, if any.
2. None of this carries a warranty or even a promise of maintenance. If it did it'd live somewhere else.
3. Apologizing for this code up front is my way of explaining away any silly mistakes I might make. It's a great way to lower expectations and diminish responsibility. Try it some time!
